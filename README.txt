INSTRUCTIONS FOR GUI

Once you start up the game, you'll have the option of 2 players or 1 player. Two player would basically be playing against yourself, I have no idea
how to make a game run between two different computers to actually play with two different people. One player would be playing against a cpu.
The player who starts is chosen randomly by the computer every game.

2-PLAYER MODE
You'll have your hand of cards on the screen. You're free to select up to 4 cards in your hand and click the "Lay Off" button to lay off your selected cards.
However, this button will only work if your selection is a set, a run, or a single card that fits in an already laid set or run.
Click on the button below a card to select it, and click the button on a card you're already selecting to deselect it. You can view which cards you have
selected because Mieu (the little blue creature) will tell you the cards you have selected.
To finish card selection mode, take a card from the deck or stack by pressing either of the buttons next to the text that labels them as such.
Once you've taken a card, you'll be given the prompt to discard a card onto the stack. Click on the button below the card you want to discard,
or the button that used to say "lay off" to discard your newest card if you now have 10 cards.
Once you've discarded a card, the turn will switch to the next player. This process will repeat until one player has no cards left, or once the 
deck of cards is empty. A winner will be announced. NOTE: There is no replay button, if you want to start over, restart the software.

1-PLAYER MODE
Playing against a CPU is a bit different. First of all, if the CPU goes first, you will not be able to see your cards until it's your turn.
During your turn, it plays the same as a 2-player game. Once your turn is done, it will be the CPU's turn. The CPU will take some time
to think so please be respectful to them. Mieu (little blue creature) will narrate what they're doing. Click on the button with the arrow on it to go
to the next line of text. The CPU will go through a step of a player turn every time you click the button, and once it's done it will be your turn
again. The game will go on until one of the two runs out of cards, or until the deck runs out of cards, in which case a winner will be decided by
points. NOTE: There is no replay button, if you want to start over, restart the software.
